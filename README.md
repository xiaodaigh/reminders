### How to set up CI for Julia

<details>
From @oxinabox

The TravisCI docs are basically correct
These three steps: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github
but not using the ruby example.

TravisCI’s specific stuff is in https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/julia/
though rather than the extremely minimal `.travis.yml` from that most people use something like
https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl/blob/master/.travis.yml
But if you don’t have docs and don’t want coverage then just the stuff from the Travis docs are fine
i.e.
```yaml
language: julia
os:
  - osx
  - linux
julia:
  - 1.0  # LTS
  - 1  # Stable
  - nightly
```

### How to find the WSL2 VM IP address?
<details>
  
`ip addr | grep eth0` then look for value under `inet`

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions
</details>

### How to let the WSL2 vm connect to local host
<details>
  
**To add**
`netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8081 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=8081 connectaddress=172.27.216.79`

**to delete**
`netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8081 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=8081 connectaddress=172.27.216.79`

### How to get plotting and Electron.jl working on WSL2?
<details>

Check this https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2855

It says
```
WSL runs OpenGL alright, but it is not a supported scenario. You didn't follow the issue template, but in general from a clean Ubuntu install from the store do:

$ sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop mesa-utils
$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0
$ glxgears
On the Windows side, install VcXsrv, choose multiple windows, display 0, start no client, disable native opengl (sic). The hang out for this stuff is generally #637, but if you have a specific scenario I'll hold this open for a bit. It might be your scenario works. It might not.

## How to set up Katago

1. Download Sabaki if you want. It's the easiest to use I found
2. Go to here https://katagotraining.org/networks/ and download the network u want. I usually just go for Strongest confidently-rated network:
3. Download a Katago executable. you need to find out whether you have a gpu and what version of cuda you are using. If u r not using cuda, then I can't help u cos I don't know
4. In Sabaki, turn on Engines Side Bar, go to manage engines. And enter something like this
5. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4497189/117558684-c4648c80-b0c2-11eb-982d-040426b21c0e.png)
you may wanna download lizzie to use it's config file
once all set. just load a sgf in Sabaki just select the engine you want to use. then press F4 to start analysing moves! Yay!
press F4 again after waiting 20s if there's an error. the engine needs some time to start up
